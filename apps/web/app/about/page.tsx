      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">About Me</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-600">
        I&apos;m studying Physics at the University of Edinburgh, where I explore everything from Robotics to Quantum Mechanics, but my fascination with discovery started long before university. Growing up, my dad&apos;s passion for travel, photography, and collecting atique maps, and fossils gave me the chance to see the world and sparked my desire to understand it. <br />
        <br /> 
        
        On the other side, I&apos;ve always been deeply influenced by my mum&apos;s compassionate nature and her talent for thoughtful gift-giving - something that&apos;s shaped my creative side. Whether it&apos;s scrapbooks, jewellery, clay figures, or painted cards, I find the most joy in sharing my creations through handmade pieces for the people I care about. <br />
         <br /> 
        Travel continues to inspire me, especially photography and exploring new cultures. A highlight for me was visiting Japan with my family. The mix of anime, design, and robotics culture felt completely up my street and left me excited to keep blending my passions for science, art, and discovery.
